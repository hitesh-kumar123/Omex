## Overview
This paper examines how rising ocean temperatures and acidification are affecting marine biodiversity, with particular focus on coral reef ecosystems and commercial fisheries.

## Key Findings
- Ocean temperatures have increased by 0.13°C per decade since 1950, accelerating to 0.23°C per decade since 1990
- Coral reef coverage has declined by 30-50% in tropical regions since 1980
- 60% of commercial fish species show altered migration patterns due to changing ocean conditions
- Ocean acidification has increased by 30% since pre-industrial times, severely impacting shellfish populations

## Methodology
The researchers analyzed 30 years of satellite data combined with direct ocean sampling across 200 sites globally. Statistical models were used to project future changes under different emissions scenarios.

## Implications
Without significant emissions reductions, the paper projects a 70% loss of coral reef ecosystems by 2050 and potential collapse of 40% of commercial fisheries, with severe economic impacts on coastal communities.

int solve(vector<vector<int>>qn,int i,vector<int>&dp){
        if(i>=qn.size())return 0;
        if(dp[i]!=-1)return dp[i];
        dp[i]=max(qn[i][0]+solve(qn,i+qn[i][1]+1,dp),solve(qn,i+1,dp));
        return dp[i];
    }
    long long mostPoints(vector<vector<int>>& questions) {
        int n=questions.size();
        int d1=0,d2=0;
        vector<int>dp(n,-1);
        return solve(questions,0,dp);
        return ans;
    }
\`\`\`
**Output:**
#### **Time Complexity Analysis:**

✅ **Use rolling DP (\`O(1) space\`) to reduce memory consumption.**

🔹 **Optimized Code (Iterative DP Approach):**
\`\`\`cpp
long long mostPoints(vector<vector<int>>& questions) {
    int n = questions.size();
    vector<long long> dp(n + 1, 0);

    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        int next = i + questions[i][1] + 1;
        long long take = questions[i][0] + (next < n ? dp[next] : 0);
        long long skip = dp[i + 1];
        dp[i] = max(take, skip);
    }
    return dp[0];
}

---

### Example Output:

**Code with Errors:**
\`\`\`javascript
function calculateAverage(numbers) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i <= numbers.length; i++) {
    sum += numbers[i];
  }
  return sum / numbers.length;
}
\`\`\`

**Error Analysis:**

1. **Loop Boundary Error (Line 3)**
   - The loop condition uses \`i <= numbers.length\` which will cause an array index out of bounds error
   - JavaScript arrays are 0-indexed, so the last valid index is \`length-1\`
   - This will attempt to access \`numbers[numbers.length]\` which is undefined

2. **No Input Validation**
   - The function doesn't check if \`numbers\` is a valid array or if it's empty
   - This could cause division by zero or errors with invalid inputs

**Corrected Code:**
\`\`\`javascript
function calculateAverage(numbers) {
  // Validate input
  if (!Array.isArray(numbers) || numbers.length === 0) {
    return 0; // or throw new Error("Invalid input: empty or not an array");
  }

  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) { // Fixed boundary condition
    sum += numbers[i];
  }
  return sum / numbers.length;
}
\`\`\`

**Prevention Tips:**
- Always use \`<\` instead of \`<=\` when iterating through arrays by index
- Add input validation at the beginning of functions
- Consider using array methods like \`reduce()\` for summing operations

### Final Note:
Your mission is to help developers identify and fix errors in their code, providing clear explanations and solutions that improve code quality and reliability.`,

### Example Output:

**Code for Analysis:**
\`\`\`javascript
function findDuplicates(array) {
  const duplicates = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < array.length; j++) {
      if (i !== j && array[i] === array[j] && !duplicates.includes(array[i])) {
        duplicates.push(array[i]);
      }
    }
  }
  return duplicates;
}
\`\`\`

**Performance Analysis:**

#### Time Complexity: O(n³)
- **Nested Loops:** O(n²) from the two nested for-loops
- **includes() Operation:** O(n) for each check inside the loops
- **Overall:** O(n²) × O(n) = O(n³)

#### Space Complexity: O(n)
- **duplicates Array:** In worst case, could store up to n/2 elements
- **No other significant memory allocation**

#### Performance Bottlenecks:
1. **Inefficient Algorithm:** The nested loops check each pair of elements multiple times
2. **Redundant Checks:** The includes() operation is called repeatedly
3. **Duplicate Work:** The same comparisons are performed multiple times

#### Optimized Solution:
\`\`\`javascript
function findDuplicates(array) {
  const seen = new Set();
  const duplicates = new Set();

  for (const item of array) {
    if (seen.has(item)) {
      duplicates.add(item);
    } else {
      seen.add(item);
    }
  }

  return [...duplicates];
}
\`\`\`

#### Optimization Benefits:
- **Time Complexity:** Reduced from O(n³) to O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** Increased slightly to O(n) for both sets
- **Performance Gain:** Exponential improvement for large arrays

#### Benchmarking Guide:
1. Create test arrays of various sizes (100, 1000, 10000 elements)
2. Measure execution time using performance.now() or similar
3. Compare memory usage with and without optimization
4. Verify correctness with various test cases

### Final Note:
Your mission is to help developers understand and improve the performance characteristics of their code, providing practical optimization strategies that balance efficiency with maintainability.`,
